Explanation of original model code from NW email

Code is for fixed effect and random effect versions of code to combine data where some is reported in collapsed categories. Assumes that it would be either 1 vs(2+3) or (1+2)vs3 [ie not (1+3) vs 2!]

Each group in each study has a group indicator g[i,k] which says which group that data corresponds to. We've numbered the groups 1,2 & 3, but for combined groups they are labelled 12 for (1+2) and 23 for (2+3). It works very much like standard NMA, but the treatment effect for the combined categories uses the proportion split between the 2 combined categories. Since this can be obtained from the proportion in group 2 (pi2) in those studies, you just need to add a column with the proportion in group 2 in the combined group. For the studies without a combined category, I’m afraid we still have to enter a number for pi2, otherwise you get an error. I’ve just put this as 1 or 0 depending on where there is a group 2, but really it doesn’t matter, since that number isn’t actually used anywhere. 

The code is general (for 3 groups anyway), and study data can be entered in any order.
