Collaboration to study the effect of malnutrition on pneumonia in LMICs

# Protocol

THis protocol will be updated as decisions regarding the analysis are made.

## Definitions of malnutrition and categories of malnutrition severity

## Missing data

Where only the odds ratio, but not the original counts from the 2x2 tables were provided, we estimated these from the confidence intervals as per (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.2287/abstract).

## Modelling choices

Since the studies [frequently collapsed categories of malnutrition severity](</Data/Collapsed_Uncollapsed numbers.csv>) , we chose to estimate the odds ratios using a Bayesian model, as this will allow us to use all of the data to estimate the odds ratios for each possible comparison.
