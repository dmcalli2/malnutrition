# Malnutrition

Collaboration to study the effect of malnutrition on pneumonia in LMICs

# Protocol

THis protocol will be updated as decisions regarding the analysis are made.

## Definitions of malnutrition and categories of malnutrition severity

## Missing data

Where only the odds ratio, but not the original counts from the 2x2 tables were provided, we estimated these from the confidence intervals as per (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.2287/abstract).

Two study authors for studies 'Hooli' and 'Webb' provied original data for these.

## Modelling choices

Since the studies [frequently collapsed categories of malnutrition severity](</Data/Collapsed_Uncollapsed numbers.csv>) , we chose to estimate the odds ratios using a Bayesian model, as this will allow us to use all of the data to estimate the odds ratios for each possible comparison.

## Key Points Regarding Specific Studies

Tupasi 1988 - This study uses an upper cut off of 75% of expected weight for age which is different to the upper cutoff of 80% used in most studies

Ballard 1995 - This study uses upper cut offs of 90% expected weight for age and weight for height and an upper cut off of 95% expected height for age which is different to the upper cutoff of 80% used in most studies

Victoria 1990 - This is a community surveillance study which measures the incidence of hospital admission of childhood pneumonia (as opposed to others which measure the incidence of developing childhood pneumonia). This can be used as a proxy for the incidence of developing severe pneumonia.
